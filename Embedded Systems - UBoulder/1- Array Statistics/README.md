This is part one of practice for the coursera course - **Introduction to Embedded Software and Development Environments**.

In this small project, a c program was created that prints statistics for a 8-bit unsigned integer array:
 - Mean;
 - Median;
 - Maximum;
 - Minimum;

# Usage - Build and run
1. Navigate to the directory containing the source code.
2. Compile the program using a C compiler, for example:
   ```
   gcc -o array_stats stats.c
   ```
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```
   ./array_stats
   ```
